# Security Analysis Tool

With the Security Analysis Tool, users can use out-of-the-box, predefined rules to improve their predictive cybersecurity analytics. These rules offer additional context for various events on the network, such as user actions and login attempts.
The Security Analysis Tool allows you to use both standard and custom rules to ensure that you adhere to best practices in security threat analysis. In addition, the SAT allows administrators to set thresholds to better define the relationships between events. Since logs are generated at any time of the day, it is easy to get lost in the noise of alerts and notifications. But SAT gives you the ability to customize alert thresholds as you see fit, so you're less likely to get useless pings or miss malicious activity on your network. If Threat Analyzer detects suspicious activity, Security Event Manager can send an automated email or SMS alert to the desired team member. The cybersecurity threat analysis tool makes it easier to identify potential problems in log data - even in a hybrid IT environment.
Security Analysis Tool is designed to send data through a built-in and constantly updated threat analytics channel designed to identify invalid IP addresses, malware, and more, and users can easily search and filter data to better isolate issues, and create custom reports. for compliance and to support forensic analysis.
